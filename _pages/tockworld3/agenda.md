TockWorld 3 was held at Stanford on February 27, 2017 to allow the growing
development team to meet and to plan a vision and roadmap for Tock development.


Location:
Gates Hall Room 211, Stanford

Time and Date:
February 27, 2017
9:30AM-5PM

## Logistics

Parking can be frustrating and painful, in part because Gates is currently
surrounded by all kinds of construction that make distances much longer than you
might expect. Give yourself at least half an hour if this is your first time
navigating this particular Tough Mudder competition.

## Meeting Goals

TockWorld 3 has three major goals (in order of importance):

1. Give an opportunity for everyone to put names to faces and get to know one
   another,
2. Discuss and reach consensus on a technical roadmap for the OS over the next
   6-12 months, and
3. Agree on a clear relationship/interaction between core Tock and Google’s
   code, to minimize duplication and prevent forking but not have Google’s code
   gated/controlled by academics.
