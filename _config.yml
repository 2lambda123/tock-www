title: Tock Embedded Operating System
desc: >
  Tock is an operating system designed for running multiple concurrent,
  mutually distrustful applications on Cortex-M based embedded platforms.
  Tock's design centers around protection, both from potentially malicious
  applications and from device drivers. Tock uses two mechanisms to protect
  different components of the operating system. First, the kernel and device
  drivers are written in Rust, a systems programming language that provides
  compile-time memory safety, type safety and strict aliasing. Tock uses Rust
  to protect the kernel (e.g. the scheduler and hardware abstraction layer)
  from platform specific device drivers as well as isolate device drivers from
  each other. Second, Tock uses memory protection units to isolate applications
  from each other and the kernel.
