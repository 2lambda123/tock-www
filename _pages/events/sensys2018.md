The Tock operating system is a secure, embedded kernel for sensor network and
Internet of Things systems using Cortex-M micro controllers. Written in the
Rust language, it supports kernel extensions in Rust as well as multiple
concurrent applications written in C, Rust, or Lua. This tutorial will give an
introduction to programming in Tock as well as an overview of its architecture.
Attendees will write a user-land networking application in C as well as a
kernel extension in Rust.
