    > Note: This workshop paper reported on challenges we ran into early on
    > building Tock in Rust. After feedback from the Rust developers and the
    > community, we were able to overcome those challanges without
    > modifications to the language. We also learned that we understated how
    > disruptive some of the changes we proposed would be to the language and
    > do not believe they are worthwhile. This [has
    > been](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rfc-and-paper-experiences-building-an-os-in-rust/3110)
    > [discussed](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3nbt2d/ownership_is_theft_experiences_building_an/)
    > [extensively](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/655816/ownership_is_theft_experiences_building_an/)
    > now in the Rust community. You should read this paper critically, not as
    > conclusive scientific findings, but as the perspectives of the authors
    > during a particular point in the development of Tock.
