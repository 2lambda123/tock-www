The Tock operating system is a secure, embedded kernel for sensor network and
Internet of Things systems using Cortex-M micro controllers. Written in the
Rust language, it supports kernel extensions in Rust as well as multiple
concurrent applications written in C, Rust, or Lua. This tutorial will give an
introduction to programming in Tock as well as an overview of its architecture.
Attendees will write a user-land networking application in C as well as a
kernel extension in Rust. Attendees will be provided hardware kits, which they
may optionally purchase as part of the registration fee.

You can register now through the SenSys [registration
page](http://sensys.acm.org/2017/registration/).  During registration, select
"Workshop or Tutorial", then select "Tock Operating System Tutorial" from the
drop-down menu titled "Which Workshop or Tutorial".
