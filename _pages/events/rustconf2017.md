Put Rust to practice in low-level embedded systems. This training will
introduce cover programming for Tock, a secure embedded operating system for
sensor networks and the Internet of Things, written in Rust. You will learn to
write kernel extensions, the basics of porting Tock to a new platform, and how
to write power- and memory-efficient applications. We will also give an
overview of the system architecture.

RustConf 2017 Trainings are Friday, August 18th (the day before the conference
proper), in Portland, OR.
