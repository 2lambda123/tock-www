# Day 1

## State of Tock

Including at least:

- The Big Picture
- Since 2.0
- Progress on Code Size


## Project presentations & Status Reports

- OpenTitan (who wants to do this?)
- Alexandru and/or team on teaching with Tock (other topics as well?)
- Hudson on Execution Bounds
- State of Ti50

There were some thoughts on remote presentations as well. Now would be a
good time to propose those and nail down with speakers.

We have room for, I think, at least two more presentations.


## Discussions: Development Focus Areas

- What are the current pain points?
- Where is effort being spent?


## Community development

- How can we build a more stable community around Tock?
- Who are the right audiences?
- Documentation and other materials? Events? Hardware platforms?
  Staffing? Governance? Online communication tools?

# Day 2

Day 2 will be organized around trying to answer (at least) two main questions:

- Who is Tock for?
- Project Governance
