Put Rust to practice in low-level embedded systems. This training will
introduce cover programming for Tock, a secure embedded operating system for
sensor networks and the Internet of Things, written in Rust. You will learn to
write kernel extensions, the basics of porting Tock to a new platform, and how
to write power- and memory-efficient applications. We will also give an
overview of the system architecture.

RustConf 2017 Trainings are Friday, August 18th (the day before the conference
proper), in Portland, OR. Register below for the conference and trainings:
