An operating system works hard to abstract away details of the underlying
hardware: virtual timers multiplex one physical timer to provide an unlimited
number of alarms; bus interfaces seamlessly share one connection across
multiple chips; processes operate independently of others running on the same
machine. At the bottom of this visage, however, is real, physical hardware.
Hardware that comes with expectations that do not always line up with software,
and it can be tricky to ensure that those expectations are met, particularly as
software gets more complex.


This post describes the recently [merged][pr] `PeripheralManager`, which helps
software ensure it always accesses hardware correctly, and cleans up after
it's done.

The key idea is to leverage Rust's [ownership model][obrm] to manage access to
peripherals. By tying hardware access to ownership of a value, we can invoke
setup and cleanup code in a principled manner before and after all peripheral
accesses.  For example, this let us move over 20 clock enable/disable calls
strewn about the SAM4L USART driver to [just one invocation][usart-commit].
Further, by meting out access to a single static reference to the USART
hardware, we removed 35 `unsafe` blocks in the USART driver alone.

## Memory-Mapped I/O

Most peripherals are implemented as [memory mapped I/O (MMIO)][mmio]. The
idea is that certain memory address are not backed by memory that you can read
and write, but rather hardware peripherals that will perform certain actions: write
this address to send a radio packet, read that address to get an ADC sample
result, etc. In practice, this means that code usually models a peripheral as
an array of words in memory at a certain location:

```rust
/// This is the SPI peripheral for the SAM4L, see ยง26.8
/// of the datasheet.
#[repr(C)]
pub struct Registers {
    pub cr: WriteOnly<u32, Control::Register>,
    pub mr: ReadWrite<u32, Mode::Register>,
    pub rdr: ReadOnly<u32>,
    pub tdr: WriteOnly<u32, TransmitData::Register>,
    sr: ReadOnly<u32, Status::Register>,
    ...

/// This is how we attach the representation above to the
/// actual location in memory.
const SPI_BASE: StaticRef<SpiRegisters> =
    unsafe { StaticRef::new(0x40008000 as *const SpiRegisters) };
```

For more information on how Tock models MMIO, check out our recent post on the
[new registers interface][tt34].


## Ownership of MMIO Objects

Because MMIO affects underlying hardware, sometimes extra care is needed.  For
example, on the SAM4L, if you attempt to read or write a peripheral while its
clock is disabled, the whole core will hang! Enter the `PeripheralManager`:

```rust
impl PeripheralManagement<pm::Clock> for SpiHw {
    type RegisterType = SpiRegisters;

    fn get_registers(&self) -> &SpiRegisters {
        &*SPI_BASE
    }

    fn get_clock(&self) -> &pm::Clock {
        &pm::Clock::PBA(pm::PBAClock::SPI)
    }

    fn before_peripheral_access(&self, clock: &pm::Clock,
                                _: &SpiRegisters) {
        clock.enable();
    }

    fn after_peripheral_access(&self, clock: &pm::Clock,
                               _: &SpiRegisters) {
        if !self.is_busy() {
            clock.disable();
        }
    }
}

type SpiRegisterManager<'a> =
        PeripheralManager<'a, SpiHw, pm::Clock>;
```

Now, whenever the driver wants to access the underlying SPI hardware, it goes
through the manager, which transparently ensures that the hardware is ready for
access before handing the reference to the driver:

```rust
impl SpiHw {
    ...

    /// Returns the value of CSR0, CSR1, CSR2, or CSR3,
    /// whichever corresponds to the active peripheral
    fn get_active_csr(&self) ->
              &regs::ReadWrite<u32, ChipSelectParams::Register> {
        let spi = &SpiRegisterManager::new(&self);

        match self.get_active_peripheral() {
            Peripheral::Peripheral0 => &spi.registers.csr[0],
            Peripheral::Peripheral1 => &spi.registers.csr[1],
            Peripheral::Peripheral2 => &spi.registers.csr[2],
            Peripheral::Peripheral3 => &spi.registers.csr[3],
        }
    }
```

The particularly cool bit here is that when the driver is done with the
hardware reference, Rust will automatically `Drop` it, which will invoke our
`after_peripheral_access` method. This gives us a single place to check things
like whether this peripheral is active (i.e. doing a DMA transfer) or whether
it can be powered off.

Power management is a notoriously hard problem for embedded operating systems,
but with the `PeripheralManager` it's surprisingly straight-forward. The
previous SAM4L USART driver had nineteen calls to `enable_clock` and five to
`disable_clock`, plus an [outstanding clock mystery][usart-int] in the
interrupt handler. By centralizing clock management, driver authors no longer
have to reason through all possible execution paths to be certain they're correctly
checking clocks everywhere. I was able to add low-power support to SPI in half
an hour and it just worked on the first try, which was absolutely mind-blowing
to me.

## PeripheralManager in Action

Today, we've adapted the USART, SPI, and I2C drivers for the SAM4L. Look for
more to move over soon, or jump in and submit a PR! We're particularly excited
to pull this into the [Signpost platform][signpost], as this energy harvesting
system has been artificially underperforming for a while due to the incomplete
low-power implementation in Tock.
