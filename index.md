Tock is a safe, multitasking operating system for low-power, low-memory
microcontrollers.
</div>

Tock is written in Rust, a type-safe systems language with no runtime or
garbage collector. It uses the Rust type system to enforce safety of
components, called capsules, in a single-threaded event-driven kernel. In
addition, Tock uses remaining memory to support processes written in any
language. This allows Tock to provide high-granularity isolation for kernel
components like drivers and virtualization layers on memory constrained
microntrollers with as little as 16KB of RAM.
