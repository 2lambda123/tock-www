## Contributing

Tock is under heavy development, primarily focused on a few chips and
platforms. We will soon be releasing our primary development platform (based on
Atmel's SAM4L). Until then, if you want to port Tock to another platform, we
encourage that and will try to help as much as we can.

The main repository is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/tock/tock).

## Communication

Tock developers communicate on the [tock-dev mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tock-dev) and on

Join us on either if you have questions or are developing for Tock.
